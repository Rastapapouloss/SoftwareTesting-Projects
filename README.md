## Introduction

Software testing is crucial in ensuring that applications function correctly and meet user expectations. This repository aims to provide practical examples of testing across different domains, helping testers and developers enhance their skills.

## Project Overview

### E-commerce Testing

E-commerce platforms require rigorous testing to ensure smooth user experiences. This section includes:

- **Test Cases**: Comprehensive test cases for various functionalities like user registration, product search, and payment processing.
- **Tools Used**: Jira for issue tracking and Xray for test management.

### Banking App Testing

Banking applications handle sensitive data and require strict testing protocols. Here, you will find:

- **Test Cases**: Detailed test cases focusing on security, transaction processes, and user account management.
- **Tools Used**: TestMonitor for managing test cases and tracking results.

### API Testing

API testing is vital for ensuring that backend services work as expected. This section covers:

- **Test Cases**: Various test cases for different API endpoints, including authentication and data retrieval.
- **Tools Used**: Postman for API testing and automation.
